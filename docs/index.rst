Open, transparent, and community-driven vote tallying for Kenya
---------------------------------------------------------------


**Community Tally** is an open source civic-tech platform created by and for Kenyans to enable **transparent, community-driven monitoring of election results** at the polling station level. 
It empowers everyday citizens, civil society actors, and developers with tools to **track, tally, and verify votes** in real time; directly from the ground, where the voting happens.

.. important::

   Community Tally is a **community-powered parallel tallying system**. It is intended to promote transparency and public engagement, **but it does not serve as an official or legally binding representation of election results**. 
   All data collected and visualized is independently submitted and verified by users, and should be considered a civic tool — not a replacement for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) or its official processes.

At its core, the platform leverages **community participation** to document and validate results as announced at polling stations, giving ordinary people a chance to be watchdogs of democracy. Through crowd-sourced data entry and review, Community Tally aims to build a trusted, parallel tallying system that complements official processes and promotes **public vigilance**.

In addition to the core results tallying functionality, Community Tally includes a special “**Community Notes**” feature that allows citizens to flag suspicious patterns, discrepancies, or signs of fraud. This mechanism is key in ensuring transparency and accountability during the electoral period.


.. note::
   
   Community Tally is not affiliated with any political party, candidate, or organization. It is a **non-partisan initiative** that aims to promote free and fair elections in Kenya.
   Whether you’re a software developer, activist, journalist, lawyer, or concerned citizen — **you have a role to play**. 

   From frontend and backend contributions, DevOps and infrastructure, legal audits, digital security, community outreach, to social media awareness — this platform thrives on the diverse strength of Kenya’s people and global allies who believe in **free, fair, and verifiable elections**.
