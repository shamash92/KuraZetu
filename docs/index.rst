Open, transparent, and community-driven vote tallying for Kenya
---------------------------------------------------------------

**Kura Zetu** is an open source civic-tech platform created by and for Kenyans to enable **transparent, community-driven monitoring of election results** at the polling station level.
It empowers everyday citizens, civil society actors, and developers with tools to **track, tally, and verify votes** in real time; directly from the ground, where the voting happens.

.. important::

   Kura Zetu is a **community-powered parallel tallying system**. It is intended to promote transparency and public engagement, **but it does not serve as an official or legally binding representation of election results**.
   All data collected and visualized is independently submitted and verified by users, and should be considered a civic tool — not a replacement for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) or its official processes.

At its core, the platform leverages **community participation** to document and validate results as announced at polling stations, giving ordinary people a chance to be watchdogs of democracy. Through crowd-sourced data entry and review, Kura Zetu aims to build a trusted, parallel tallying system that complements official processes and promotes **public vigilance**.

In addition to the core results tallying functionality, Kura Zetu includes a special “**Community Notes**” feature that allows citizens to flag suspicious patterns, discrepancies, or signs of fraud. This mechanism is key in ensuring transparency and accountability during the electoral period.
