**Kura Zetu** is an open source platform (plus mobile app) built **by and for Kenyans** to empower communities to **track, verify, and tally election results** at the polling station level.

In Kenya, every voter has access to a smart phone, and since results announced at the polling station are final, we believe the public can play a powerful role in protecting the vote. We can all be agents.

With features like crowdsourced uploads, real-time tallies, and a community notes system for public verification, the platform enables everyday citizens, developers, journalists, civil society, and oversight bodies to participate in safeguarding the integrity of elections — from the ground up.

The platform is designed to be **open source** and **community-driven**, allowing anyone to contribute, verify, and improve the system.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
>
> This project is **not an official tallying system**. It is **not a legal representation** of election results, and it does **not replace** the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) systems.
> It is a **parallel citizen-led tool** for transparency, verification, and civic vigilance.

## 🤷‍♂️ Why Kura Zetu?

Kenya has over **46,000 polling stations**. Each polling station posts **Form 34A** results that are legally binding — but these results are often hard to verify at scale by citizens.

Kura Zetu aims to solve this by:

- **Crowdsourcing results** from each polling station
- Allowing the public to **cross-verify votes** and flag irregularities
- Providing a **live, transparent tally dashboard**
- Creating a **"Community Notes"** system where users can flag suspected fraud, misinformation, or conflicting results
