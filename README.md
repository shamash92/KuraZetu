**Community Tally** is an open source platform built **by and for Kenyans** to empower communities to **track, verify, and tally election results** at the polling station level.

It enables everyday citizens, developers, journalists, civil society, and oversight bodies to actively participate in protecting the integrity of elections — **from the ground up**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
>
> This project is **not an official tallying system**. It is **not a legal representation** of election results, and it does **not replace** the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) systems.
> It is a **parallel citizen-led tool** for transparency, verification, and civic vigilance.

## 🤷‍♂️ Why Community Tally?

Kenya has over **46,000 polling stations**. Each polling station posts **Form 34A** results that are legally binding — but these results are often hard to verify at scale by citizens.

Community Tally aims to solve this by:

- **Crowdsourcing results** from each polling station
- Allowing the public to **cross-verify votes** and flag irregularities
- Providing a **live, transparent tally dashboard**
- Creating a **"Community Notes"** system where users can flag suspected fraud, misinformation, or conflicting results
